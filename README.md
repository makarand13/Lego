# Lego Inventory System
This repository is for tracking and inventorying all the Lego pieces I have. There are also a couple of scripts that analyze and produce a CSV with compounded data for all the different types of pieces. References are used from Bricklink Parts, Minifig, Gears and Colors catalog found here - [Bricklink Catalog](https://www.bricklink.com/catalog.asp)
